Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing sales, costs, and profitability using a financial dataset.

# 📊 Financial Dashboard – Power BI (Mini Project Phase 2)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is the **second phase** of my mini project, focusing on creating an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to analyze a financial dataset.  

The dashboard provides clear insights into:
- Overall business performance  
- Sales and revenue drivers  
- Cost efficiency and profitability  
- Market and geographic contributions  

This builds on **Phase 1 (Excel Preprocessing)**, where I cleaned and prepared the dataset.

## 🔄 Project Workflow
- **Phase 1:** Data Preprocessing (Excel) → cleaning, formatting, and preparing the dataset  
- **Phase 2:** Dashboard & Visualization (Power BI) → creating an interactive multi-page dashboard  

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Dataset Source: Preprocessed dataset from **Phase 1** (https://github.com/Adwaithasree/Mini-Project-Phase-1)  
- Key Columns:  
  - **Sales, Profit, COGS, Discounts, Gross Sales** (financial metrics)  
  - **Product, Segment, Country** (categorical dimensions)  
  - **Date, Year, Month** (time dimension)

## 📑 Dashboard Pages
The dashboard is divided into **4 sheets (pages)** for clear storytelling:

### 1️⃣ Performance Snapshot  
- KPIs: Total Sales, Total Profit, Total COGS, Average Discount  
- Sales & Profit trend over time (line chart)  
- Sales vs Profit by Country (clustered column chart)  

### 2️⃣ Revenue Flow  
- Sales by Product (clustered column chart)  
- Sales vs Discounts over time (combo chart)  
- Gross Sales vs Discounts % by Product (100% stacked column chart)  
- Sales by Segment (bar chart)  

### 3️⃣ Cost Dynamics  
- COGS Trend over time (line chart)  
- Total COGS by Product (bar/column chart)  
- Maximum & Minimum COGS (cards)  
- COGS vs Sales (scatter plot, bubble size = Profit)  

### 4️⃣ Market Pulse  
- Sales by Country (map visual)  
- Sales & Profit by Country (bar chart)  
- Sales share by Segment (donut chart)  
- Regional Breakdown (table)  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** → Data preprocessing (Phase 1)  
- **Power BI Desktop** → Interactive dashboard (Phase 2)  
- **DAX** → Custom measures (Profit Margin %, Discount %, ASP, etc.)  
- **GitHub** → Project documentation & version control  


## ✨ Key Learnings
- Built KPIs and measures using **DAX**  
- Designed **multi-page dashboards** for storytelling  
- Created **interactive slicers** (Year, Country, Segment, Product)  
- Used **maps, donuts, combo charts** for richer insights  
- Linked **Phase 1 (Excel preprocessing)** with **Phase 2 (Dashboard)** for end-to-end workflow
